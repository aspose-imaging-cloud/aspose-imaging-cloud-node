# Aspose.Imaging for Cloud Node.js SDK
[Aspose.Imaging for Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging/cloud) is a true REST API that enables you to perform a wide range of image processing operations including creation, manipulation and conversion in the cloud, with zero initial costs. Our Cloud SDKs are wrappers around REST API in various programming languages, allowing you to process images in language of your choice quickly and easily, gaining all benefits of strong types and IDE highlights. 

This repository contains Aspose.Imaging for Cloud Node.js SDK source code which is written in TypeScript. This SDK allows you to work with Aspose.Imaging for Cloud REST APIs in your Node.js applications quickly and easily, with zero initial cost.
